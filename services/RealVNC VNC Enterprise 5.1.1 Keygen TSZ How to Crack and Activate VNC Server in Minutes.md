RealVNC is one of the leading providers of VNC software, offering both free and paid versions for different platforms and needs. RealVNC VNC Enterprise is the premium version of RealVNC, which offers enhanced security, performance, and features for business and professional users.

## Step 1: Download and Install RealVNC VNC Enterprise 5.1.1
 
The first step is to download and install RealVNC VNC Enterprise 5.1.1 on your VNC server computer. You can download it from the official website[^1^] or from other sources[^2^] [^3^]. Make sure you download the correct version for your operating system and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit).
 
After downloading the installer file, run it and follow the instructions on the screen. You will be asked to choose between a typical or custom installation. We recommend choosing the typical installation, which will install the VNC server and viewer components on your computer.
 
You will also be asked to enter a license key during the installation process. You can skip this step for now, as we will use the TSZ Keygen to generate a license key later.
 
## Step 2: Download and Run the TSZ Keygen
 
The next step is to download and run the TSZ Keygen program, which can generate license keys for RealVNC VNC Enterprise 5.1.1. You can download it from various sources[^4^], but be careful of fake or malicious downloads that may contain viruses or malware.
 
After downloading the TSZ Keygen file, extract it to a folder on your computer. You will see two executable files: cr-realvnc\_enterprise.exe and cr-realvnc\_viewer.exe. These are the keygen programs for the VNC server and viewer components respectively.
 
Run the cr-realvnc\_enterprise.exe file as an administrator by right-clicking on it and choosing "Run as administrator". You will see a window with a button that says "Generate". Click on it and wait for a few seconds until a license key appears in the text box below.
 
## Step 3: Activate Your VNC Server with the License Key
 
The final step is to activate your VNC server with the license key generated by the TSZ Keygen. To do this, open the RealVNC Server application on your computer by clicking on its icon in the system tray or by searching for it in the Start menu.
 
You will see a window with a tab that says "Licensing". Click on it and then click on the button that says "Enter license key...". A dialog box will appear where you can paste or type in the license key from the TSZ Keygen.
 
Click on "OK" and wait for a few seconds until you see a message that says "License applied successfully". Congratulations! You have successfully activated your VNC server with RealVNC VNC Enterprise 5.1.1 using the TSZ Keygen.
