## Features
 
Trainz 2019 DLC - Cornish Mainline (TANE Edition) is a route created by Bob Cooper for Trainz A New Era. It is compatible with TRS19 but should not be confused with the updated TRS19 version which is part of the Full, Platinum and UK Editions[^3^]. This DLC requires the base game Trainz Railroad Simulator 2019 on Steam in order to play[^1^]. It supports English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Russian languages[^1^].
 
The DLC features the Cornish Main Line, which was originally built by two separate railway companies in the 19th century: the West Cornwall Railway between Truro and Penzance, and the Cornwall Railway between Plymouth and Truro[^1^]. The route runs between Truro and Penzance and includes branch lines to Falmouth (The Maritime Route), Helston, Hayle Wharves and St Ives[^1^]. The route covers a total of 78 miles of track and offers a variety of scenery, from coastal views to rural landscapes.
 
## Content
 
The DLC includes 12 locomotives and 22 rolling stock items, such as steam engines, diesel trains, passenger coaches, freight wagons, and brake vans. Some of the notable locomotives are the GWR Castle Class 4-6-0 No. 5051 Earl Bathurst, the BR Standard Class 4MT 2-6-4T No. 80064, the BR Class 37/4 No. 37425 Sir Robert McAlpine/Concrete Bob, and the BR Class 47/4 No. 47501 Craftsman. The rolling stock items are mostly from the Great Western Railway (GWR) and British Railways (BR) eras.
 
The DLC also includes 10 sessions that let you drive trains on the route or watch them as an observer. The sessions range from simple scenarios like shunting wagons at Hayle Wharves to complex ones like running express services between Plymouth and Penzance. The sessions are designed to showcase the different aspects of the route and its history, such as the gauge conversion in 1892, the holiday traffic in the 20th century, and the vegetable produce from Cornwall.
 
## Gameplay
 
The gameplay of Trainz 2019 DLC - Cornish Mainline (TANE Edition) is similar to other Trainz routes. You can drive trains using either the cab view or the external view, control the speed, direction, brakes, horn, whistle, lights, and other features of your locomotive, couple and uncouple wagons, switch tracks, follow signals and speed limits, and complete objectives. You can also explore the route using free roam mode or create your own sessions using surveyor mode.
 
The route offers a realistic and immersive experience of driving trains on the Cornish Main Line. The track layout, scenery, landmarks, stations, bridges, tunnels, signals, and level crossings are accurately modeled based on Google Earth images[^1^]. The route also features dynamic weather effects, day-night cycle, seasonal changes, ambient sounds, animated objects, and interactive industries. The route is challenging to drive due to its steep gradients, tight curves, and busy traffic.
 
## Conclusion
 
Trainz 2019 DLC - Cornish Mainline (TANE Edition) is a high-quality DLC that adds a new dimension to your Trainz Railroad Simulator 2019 game. It is a must-have for Trainz fans who love British railways or historical routes. It is also a great way to learn about the history and culture of Cornwall and its railways. The DLC is available on Steam for $19.99 USD[^1^] or on
