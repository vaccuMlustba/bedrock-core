Banished was released in February 2014 by Shining Rock Software, a one-man studio led by Luke Hodorowicz. Since then, the game has received several updates and patches, as well as modding support that allows players to create and share their own content. The latest update is the 1.0.5 beta build, which was released in May 2016. This update introduces major engine changes to support future games from Shining Rock and new versions of Banished on other platforms, including Mac and Linux[^1^]. It also includes bug fixes and changes to the game's mod kit[^2^].
 
If you want to try out the 1.0.5 beta build, you can download it from the official website[^1^] or from Steam[^3^].

To install mods for Banished, you need to have the game updated to the latest version (1.0.5 beta or 1.0.4). You also need to have the mod kit installed, which you can download from the official website. Once you have the mod kit, you can unzip the mod files into the WinData folder in your Banished installation directory. Then, you can enable or disable mods from the main menu of the game. Be careful not to use too many mods at once, as they might conflict with each other or cause performance issues. You should also backup your save games before using mods, as they might not be compatible with different versions of the game or mods.
 
Banished is a game that requires a lot of planning and patience. You have to make sure your population has enough food, firewood, clothing, tools, and health care. You also have to deal with disasters such as fires, diseases, tornadoes, and raids. Here are some tips for playing Banished:
 
- Start small and expand gradually. Don't build too many houses too fast, as that will increase your population and your resource consumption.
- Focus on food production first. Build a variety of food sources, such as farms, orchards, pastures, fishing docks, hunting cabins, and gatherers huts. Try to have a surplus of food stored in barns and markets.
- Keep an eye on your resource limits. You can adjust them from the limits window or by clicking on the resource icons on the status bar. If you reach a limit, your workers will stop producing that resource and move on to other tasks.
- Diversify your economy. Don't rely on one type of resource or trade good. Try to produce different kinds of materials, such as iron, coal, stone, wood, leather, wool, herbs, ale, etc. You can use them for your own needs or trade them with merchants for other goods.
- Educate your population. Build a schoolhouse as soon as possible and assign a teacher to it. Educated workers are more productive and efficient than uneducated ones.
