However, there is a catch. The free trial of Camtasia Studio 8 adds a watermark to your videos that says "Made with Camtasia Trial". This watermark cannot be removed unless you buy a license key or use a third-party tool. Therefore, if you want to use Camtasia Studio 8 for free without any watermark, you need to use another method.
 
## How to Use Camtasia Studio 8 Legally
 
The best way to use Camtasia Studio 8 legally is to buy a license key from TechSmith. This will not only remove the watermark from your videos but also give you access to future updates and support. You can buy a license key from the website or from an authorized reseller.
 
If you are a student or an educator, you can get a discount on Camtasia Studio 8 by verifying your academic status. You can also get a volume discount if you buy multiple licenses for your organization or team. You can check the pricing and options on the website.
 
Another way to use Camtasia Studio 8 legally is to use an older version of the software that is no longer supported by TechSmith. For example, Camtasia Studio 7 was released in 2010 and was discontinued in 2014. However, you can still download it from some websites and use it without any watermark or limitation.
 
However, using an older version of Camtasia Studio has some drawbacks. You may not be able to open or edit files created with newer versions of Camtasia. You may also encounter compatibility issues with newer operating systems or devices. Moreover, you may not get any security updates or bug fixes from TechSmith.
