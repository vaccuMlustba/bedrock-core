Boardmaker v6 is a special education platform that supports education, communication, access and social/emotional needs of students with disabilities[^4^]. It allows you to create symbol-based materials such as communication displays, worksheets, flash cards, books and more[^5^]. However, Boardmaker v6 is not a free software and requires a license key to activate it. If you want to use Boardmaker v6 without paying for it, you might be tempted to look for a crack online. But is it safe and legal to do so? In this article, we will explain what a crack is, how it works, and what are the risks and consequences of using one.
  
## What is a crack?
 
A crack is a modified version of a software that bypasses or removes its copy protection mechanism. A copy protection mechanism is a feature that prevents unauthorized copying or use of a software. For example, Boardmaker v6 uses SecuROM 7.35.0008 as its copy protection mechanism[^2^]. SecuROM checks if the CD inserted in the drive is the original one or not. If not, it displays an error message and prevents the software from running. A crack can either modify the executable file of Boardmaker v6 or create a virtual drive that emulates the original CD. This way, SecuROM is fooled into thinking that the software is legitimate and allows it to run.

## How does a crack work?
 
A crack can be downloaded from various websites that offer illegal software downloads. These websites often have misleading names and descriptions that make them look like official sources or support forums. For example, one of the websites that offers a crack for Boardmaker v6 is called "WonTV plus" and claims to be a "forum" for "espanol" speakers[^3^]. However, this website has nothing to do with Boardmaker or Tobii Dynavox, the company that owns Boardmaker. It is actually a website that hosts malware and viruses that can harm your computer.
 
To use a crack, you need to follow some steps that vary depending on the type of crack. For example, one of the methods described on another website called "DAEMON Tools Forum" involves using Alcohol 120%, a software that can create and mount virtual drives[^2^]. The steps are as follows:

1. After putting the CD to be copied into your drive start Alcohol 120% and click on âImage Making Wizardâ.
2. At the next screen, select the drive into which you put your CD as the reading device, set the reading speed (Maximum is fine) and set the datatype as Securom \*New (4.x/5.x).Then click on âNextâ.
3. At this screen you will see two boxes: âImage Nameâ and âImage Formatâ. The image name will be automatically filled in with âBM Plus v6 [7447F0A2]â. You can change this if you want but itâs not necessary. The image format should be set as âMedia Descriptor Image file (\*.mds)â. Then click on âStartâ.
4. Wait until Alcohol finishes creating your image file. This may take some time depending on your computer speed and CD drive speed.
5. When Alcohol finishes creating your image file you will see this screen. Click on âFinishâ.
6. Now you have created an image file of your original CD. You need to mount this image file in a virtual drive using Alcohol 120% or another software like DAEMON Tools.
7. After mounting your image file in a virtual drive you can run Boardmaker v6 from there without inserting your original CD.

## What are the risks and consequences of using a crack?

- You may download malware or viruses along with the crack that can damage your computer or steal your personal information.
