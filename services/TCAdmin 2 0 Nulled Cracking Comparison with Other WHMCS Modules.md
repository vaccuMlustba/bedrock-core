# How to Download and Install the Latest R4i Gold Plus Firmware
 
If you are looking for a way to play your favorite Nintendo DS games on your 3DS or 2DS system, you might want to consider getting an R4i Gold Plus card. This is a flashcard that allows you to run homebrew applications, emulators, multimedia files, and backup copies of your games on your console. However, before you can use your R4i Gold Plus card, you need to download and install the latest firmware on it. The firmware is the software that runs on your card and enables it to work with your system. In this article, we will show you how to download and install the latest R4i Gold Plus firmware in a few simple steps.
  
## Step 1: Download the Latest R4i Gold Plus Firmware
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the latest R4i Gold Plus firmware from the official website. As of March 3rd, 2023, the latest firmware version is v1.64, which supports the latest 3DS and 2DS system software version 11.15.0 and the DSi XL up to 1.45[^1^] [^2^]. You can download the firmware file from here[^2^]. The file is in a zip format, so you will need to extract it using a program like 7-Zip[^1^]. You should see a folder called "Wood\_R4iGold\_V1.64" after extracting the file.

## Step 2: Copy the Firmware Files to Your Micro SD Card
 
The next thing you need to do is to copy the firmware files to your micro SD card that you will use with your R4i Gold Plus card. You can use any micro SD card with a capacity of up to 32GB, but make sure it is formatted to FAT32 file system. To copy the firmware files, simply drag and drop the "\_rpg" folder and the "\_DS\_MENU.DAT" file from the "Wood\_R4iGold\_V1.64" folder to the root directory of your micro SD card. The root directory is the main folder that you see when you open your micro SD card on your computer.

## Step 3: Insert Your Micro SD Card into Your R4i Gold Plus Card
 
Once you have copied the firmware files to your micro SD card, you can insert it into your R4i Gold Plus card. Make sure that the micro SD card is inserted all the way into the slot on the back of the card. You should hear a click when it is properly inserted.
  
## Step 4: Switch Your R4i Gold Plus Card to DS Mode
 
The R4i Gold Plus card has a built-in switch that allows you to quickly and easily swap between the regular R4i mode and the NTRBoot mode. The NTRBoot mode is used for installing custom firmware (CFW) on your console, which gives you more features and functions than the official firmware. However, if you just want to use your R4i Gold Plus card for playing games and homebrew, you need to switch it to DS mode. To do this, simply slide the switch on the side of the card to "D". You should see a small "D" icon on the sticker of the card when it is in DS mode.
  
## Step 5: Insert Your R4i Gold Plus Card into Your Console
 
The final step is to insert your R4i Gold Plus card into your console's game slot. Make sure that the card is inserted all the way into the slot until it clicks into place. Then, turn on your console and select the game icon that says "Bomberman Land Touch! 2". This is actually a fake game title that disguises your R4i Gold Plus card from being detected by your console's anti-piracy measures. After selecting this game icon, you should see a menu screen that says "Wood R4 V1.64" at the top. This means that your R4i Gold Plus card is working properly and ready to use.
