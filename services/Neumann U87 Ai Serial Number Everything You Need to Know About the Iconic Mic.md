### Sound Quality
 
The Neumann U87 Ai is a premium microphone that is handcrafted in Germany with high-quality components and strict quality control. Each microphone is individually tested and calibrated to ensure optimal performance and consistency.
 
However, there are many counterfeit microphones on the market that try to imitate the look and sound of the U87 Ai. These microphones are often made with cheap materials and poor craftsmanship, resulting in inferior sound quality and durability. They may also have fake or stolen serial numbers that do not match the original ones.
 
By checking the serial number of your microphone, you can verify if it is a genuine Neumann product or not. You can also compare your serial number with the official database of Neumann microphones on their website: [https://www.neumann.com/serialnumbers](https://www.neumann.com/serialnumbers). If your serial number is not listed or does not match the model and year of production, you may have a counterfeit microphone.
 
### Warranty
 
The Neumann U87 Ai comes with a two-year warranty that covers any defects or malfunctions that may occur during normal use. This warranty is only valid for the original owner of the microphone and requires proof of purchase from an authorized dealer.
 
If you buy a second-hand microphone or from an unauthorized dealer, you may not be eligible for the warranty. You may also lose your warranty if you modify or repair your microphone without authorization from Neumann.
 
By checking the serial number of your microphone, you can confirm if it is still under warranty or not. You can also register your microphone on the Neumann website to extend your warranty by one year: [https://www.neumann.com/warranty](https://www.neumann.com/warranty). This will also help you receive updates and support from Neumann in case of any issues.
