The library requires about 2 GB of disk space and 1 GB of RAM. You can download it from the Best Service website or purchase it as a boxed version.
 
One of the main features of Best Service Desert Winds is the real legato mode, which allows you to play smooth and realistic transitions between notes. You can choose from up to six different legato types per instrument, depending on the speed and style of your playing. You can also adjust the legato volume and crossfade time to suit your preference.
 
Another feature of Best Service Desert Winds is the extensive articulation menu, which gives you access to various playing techniques such as bends, trills, grace notes, ornaments, vibrato, staccato and more. You can switch between articulations using key switches or MIDI CCs. You can also customize the key switch layout and assign your own MIDI CCs to control different parameters.
 
Best Service Desert Winds also comes with a convolution reverb module, which lets you add realistic ambience to your sound.

In this section, we will take a closer look at each of the four instruments included in Best Service Desert Winds and explore their characteristics and sound. We will also listen to some audio examples and compare them with other ethnic wind instrument libraries on the market.
 
## The Armenian Duduk
 
The Armenian Duduk is a double-reed woodwind instrument that has a warm and melancholic tone. It is often used in Armenian folk music and film scores. The Duduk has a range of about one octave and can produce quarter tones and glissandos. The Duduk in Best Service Desert Winds is played by Djivan Gasparyan, a renowned Armenian musician who has collaborated with artists such as Peter Gabriel, Hans Zimmer and Brian Eno.
 
The Duduk in Best Service Desert Winds sounds very realistic and expressive, thanks to the true legato and articulations. You can hear the breath noise and the reed vibration, which add to the authenticity of the sound. You can also use the microtuning feature to play in different modes and scales. Here is an audio example of the Duduk in Best Service Desert Winds:

As you can hear, both libraries sound very good and similar, but the Duduk in Desert Winds has a slightly more detailed and nuanced sound, especially in the legato transitions.
 
## The Persian Ney
 
The Persian Ney is a flute-like instrument that has a breathy and airy sound. It is one of the oldest musical instruments in the world and is widely used in Persian classical music and Sufi music. The Ney has a range of about two octaves and can produce microtones and ornaments. The Ney in Best Service Desert Winds is played by Nure Dovlatov, a master of Persian music who has performed with many famous musicians such as Hossein Alizadeh, Kayhan Kalhor and Mohammad Reza Shajarian.
 
The Ney in Best Service Desert Winds sounds very realistic and expressive, thanks to the true legato and articulations. You can hear the subtle variations in the tone and the breath control, which add to the realism of the sound. You can also use the microtuning feature to play in different modes and scales. Here is an audio example of the Ney in Best Service Desert Winds:
 <audio src="https://www.bestservice.com/samples/desert_winds/desert_winds_persian_ney_demo.mp3" controls=""></audio>
