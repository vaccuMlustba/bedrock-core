# AudioThing â Frostbite 2 v2.0.0 x64 VST: A Spectral Freezing Plugin for Ambient Soundscapes
 
AudioThing is an audio software company that specializes in audio plugins for various formats, such as VST2, VST3, AU, AAX, and CLAP[^3^]. One of their products is Frostbite 2, a spectral freezing plugin that can transform any sound into ambient textures, soundscapes, or frozen reverbs[^1^] [^2^].
 
Frostbite 2 has four freezing modes: spectral, reverb, convolution, and granular. Each mode has its own characteristics and parameters that can be adjusted to create different effects. For example, spectral mode uses FFT to store and replay analysis windows with randomized phases, reverb mode uses a classic reverb algorithm with infinite decay, convolution mode multiplies the input signal with a randomly generated noise impulse, and granular mode chops the input signal into small grains that are randomly processed[^1^].

In addition to the freezing module, Frostbite 2 also features a ring modulator and a feedback module that can further enhance or mangle the frozen sound. The ring modulator can create metallic or bell-like sounds by multiplying the input signal with a sine wave or a noise source. The feedback module can create resonant or chaotic effects by feeding back the output signal into the input with variable delay and gain[^1^].

Frostbite 2 also has a flexible routing system that allows you to rearrange the modules with a simple drag-and-drop and select between serial and parallel modes. Serial mode processes the signal through each module in sequence, while parallel mode splits the signal into three paths and processes them separately before mixing them together[^1^].
 
Furthermore, Frostbite 2 has an internal LFO that can modulate most of the parameters on each module, creating evolving and dynamic soundscapes. The LFO has multiple waveforms and destinations to choose from, as well as sync and rate options[^1^].
 
Frostbite 2 comes with over 70 presets that showcase its capabilities and offer a starting point for your own creations. You can also use the preset system with randomizer to generate new sounds with a single click[^1^].
 
Frostbite 2 is compatible with Windows 7 or higher and macOS 10.9 or higher, and supports 64-bit VST2, VST3, AU, and AAX formats. It requires a 2GHz CPU and 4 GB of RAM. You can activate it online or offline with a license file that you can purchase from AudioThing's website[^1^].
 
If you are looking for a spectral freezing plugin that can create ambient textures, soundscapes, or frozen reverbs with ease and versatility, you should check out AudioThing â Frostbite 2 v2.0.0 x64 VST.
  
## How to Use Frostbite 2 Plugin
 
Frostbite 2 is a versatile and powerful plugin that can be used for various purposes, such as creating ambient textures, soundscapes, frozen reverbs, metallic sounds, resonant effects, and more. In this section, we will show you some examples of how to use Frostbite 2 plugin with different sounds and settings.
 
### Example 1: Freezing a Synth Pad
 
In this example, we will use Frostbite 2 to freeze a synth pad and create an evolving soundscape. We will use the following settings:
 
- Freeze mode: Spectral
- Freeze amount: 100%
- Freeze length: 8 seconds
- Freeze random: 50%
- Ring modulator: Off
- Feedback: Off
- LFO: Off

We will also automate the freeze button to turn it on and off at different intervals. Here is the result:
 `` 
As you can hear, the synth pad is frozen into a spectral texture that changes over time with random phases. The freeze button creates variations in the frozen sound by switching between the original signal and the frozen signal.
 
### Example 2: Freezing a Drum Loop
 
In this example, we will use Frostbite 2 to freeze a drum loop and create a granular effect. We will use the following settings:

- Freeze mode: Granular
- Freeze amount: 100%
- Freeze length: 0.5 seconds
- Freeze random: 100%
- Ring modulator: Off
- Feedback: Off
- LFO: Off

We will also automate the freeze button to turn it on and off at different intervals. Here is the result:
 `` 
As you can hear, the drum loop is frozen into small grains that are randomly processed and played back. The freeze button creates variations in the granular sound by switching between the original signal and the frozen signal.
