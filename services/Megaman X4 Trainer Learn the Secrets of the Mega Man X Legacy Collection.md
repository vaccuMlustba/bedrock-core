That's where a trainer comes in handy. A trainer is a program that runs in the background and modifies the game's memory to enable certain features or options. For example, you can use a trainer to get infinite health, infinite retries, god mode, or change the game speed. There are different trainers available for Megaman X4 on PC, but one of the most popular ones is the one made by Delta Dreamer[^1^]. This trainer has 17 options that you can activate with hotkeys.
 
To use this trainer, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the trainer from [GameCopyWorld](https://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_megaman_x4.shtml) [^1^] or another trusted source.
2. Extract the trainer file (MMX4Trn.exe) to the same folder where you installed Megaman X4.
3. Run the trainer as administrator before launching the game.
4. You will see a small window with the trainer options and their corresponding hotkeys. You can also change the hotkeys by clicking on them and pressing a new key.
5. Launch the game and start playing. You can activate or deactivate the trainer options by pressing the hotkeys at any time during the game.
6. Enjoy!

Note: Some antivirus programs may detect the trainer as a virus or malware, but this is a false positive. The trainer is safe to use and does not harm your computer or game files. However, you should always make a backup of your game files before using any trainer or cheat program.

The game's story follows the events of Megaman X3, where X and Zero defeated Dr. Doppler and his army of Mavericks. However, peace is short-lived as a new threat emerges: the Repliforce, a military organization of Reploids who seek independence from humans. The Repliforce leader, Colonel, declares war on humanity after being accused of being involved in a terrorist attack on a human city. X and Zero are sent to stop the Repliforce and prevent a global war.
 
The game allows the player to choose between X and Zero as the main character, each with their own abilities and storylines. X can use different weapons and armors that he obtains from defeating bosses, while Zero can use his Z-Saber and learn new techniques from bosses. The game also features multiple endings depending on the character and the choices made during the game.
