Design of Machine Elements is a thorough and comprehensive textbook on machine elements that presents the concepts, procedures, data, tools, and techniques students need to design safe, efficient and workable mechanical components of machines. The book covers both the conventional design methodology and the new tools such as CAD, optimization and FEM, design procedures for the most frequently encountered mechanical elements such as shafts, gears, bearings, springs, clutches, brakes, belts, chains, screws, fasteners, and welded joints. The book also includes numerous worked-out examples, end-of-chapter questions and exercises, and multiple-choice questions to enhance students' learning and hone their design skills.
 
The book is written by T.J. Prabhu, who is an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Jai Narain Vyas University (JNVS), Jodhpur. He has over 20 years of academic experience and his areas of research interest include CAD/CAM and Finite Element Analysis. He has published 15 papers in various reputed journals. The book is co-authored by C.S. Sharma, who is a former Professor (Mechanical Engineering) at JNVS and has had a brilliant academic career spanning 38 years. He has guided more than 50 M.Tech dissertations and seven Doctoral theses. He has to his credit more than 75 research papers published in reputed journals.

Machine element design is a crucial aspect of mechanical engineering, as it determines the performance, reliability and efficiency of machines. Machine element design involves applying the principles of mechanics, materials science, manufacturing and engineering analysis to select the most suitable materials, shapes, dimensions and tolerances for each machine element. Machine element design also considers the loading conditions, environmental factors, safety factors, cost and availability of the machine elements.
 
Machine element design can be done using analytical methods, numerical methods or experimental methods. Analytical methods involve applying mathematical equations and formulas to calculate the stresses, strains, deflections and other parameters of the machine elements. Numerical methods involve using computer software such as CAD, FEM or optimization tools to model and simulate the behavior of the machine elements. Experimental methods involve testing the machine elements in laboratory or field conditions to measure their performance and validate their design.
 
Machine element design is an iterative process that requires creativity, innovation and problem-solving skills. Machine element design often involves trade-offs between conflicting objectives such as strength, weight, durability, cost and aesthetics. Machine element design also requires collaboration and communication with other engineers, manufacturers and customers to ensure that the machine elements meet the specifications and expectations.
